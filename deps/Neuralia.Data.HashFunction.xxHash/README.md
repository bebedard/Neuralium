This library contains a modification on the xxHash non cryptographic hashing algorithm.

## Build Instructions

##### First, ensure dotnet core 2.2 SDK is installed

the best way to include it into other projects is to build it as a nuget package. 
To do so, simply invoke pack.sh
> ./pack.sh
this will produce a package name Neuralia.System.Data.HashFunction.xxHash.*[version]*.nupkg
